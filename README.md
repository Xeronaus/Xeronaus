## Hello There 👋
I'm Xeronaus Finezero, but you can just call me by Xeronaus ☝️

## About Me 🧻
I'm a guy ♂️ from Indonesia 🇮🇩 and I'm quite comfortable over there.

I like STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).

My favorite games are [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net), [Mindustry](https://mindustrygame.github.io), [Terraria](https://terraria.org), [BTD6](https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Mobile/Bloons-TD-6.html), and [Infinitode 2](https://infinitode.prineside.com).

I'm going to write some extra words just to make another "real" sentence ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯

I can speak both Indonesian 🇮🇩 and English 🇺🇲🇬🇧 but also currently learning Russian 🇷🇺

> Can anyone teach me Russian? Please?

If you would like to know more, feel free to ask!
